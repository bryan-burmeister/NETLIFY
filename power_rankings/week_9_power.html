  <h2>🥇 1. Sunday Afternoon Bo Jobs (mattburmeister) — 8-1, 1336.7 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Bo Nix (177.6 pts)</p>
  <p>Bo Nix is out here slinging balls like he’s trying to get a sponsorship from Trojan. Every deep shot lands, every completion leaves defenders questioning their life choices.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> This roster’s so dominant it needs a safe word. Opponents show up, take their L, and leave emotionally raw.</p>
</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>🥈 2. DolfinStrykers (dolfinstrykers) — 6-3, 1281.1 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Matthew Stafford (165.9 pts)</p>
  <p>Stafford’s still going strong like a middle-aged man with a secret prescription and a weekend free of kids. You can’t kill this man’s fantasy libido.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> The DolfinStrykers are the quiet freaks — look vanilla at first, then drop 140 on you out of nowhere. It’s missionary, but with eye contact that ruins lives.</p>
</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>🥉 3. BabyBilly’s Bible Ballers (kris3434) — 6-3, 1269.1 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Bijan Robinson (168.8 pts)</p>
  <p>Bijan runs harder than your ex’s rebound — smooth, powerful, and leaving defenders begging for aftercare.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> This team’s got that “praise the Lord and pass the lube” energy. Sanctified smut. Every Sunday feels like church… if church had more body oil.</p>
</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>4. Smashville (bburmeister170) — 5-4, 1351.0 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Christian McCaffrey (231.2 pts)</p>
  <p>CMC scores so often it’s starting to feel like a public indecency charge waiting to happen. You can’t spell “fantasy climax” without McCaffrey.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> Smashville lives up to its name — pure stamina, no commitment. They’ll blow you out, leave you breathless, and never text you again.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>5. Diamond Dogs (BenVan) — 5-4, 1248.9 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Josh Allen (182.1 pts)</p>
  <p>Josh Allen’s throwing heat like a man trying to win back his ex with unsolicited nudes. Every pass is pure confidence and zero shame.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> Diamond Dogs are like a power couple in their toxic phase — dominant, dramatic, and somehow still turning everyone on.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>6. The Plague (willpetsche) — 5-4, 1235.4 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Tyler Warren (139.4 pts)</p>
  <p>Tyler Warren’s that sneaky hookup who you didn’t expect to be good — and now you’re questioning everything you thought you knew about your preferences.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> This roster spreads faster than gossip in a small town. Every matchup starts with “it’s just a sniffle” and ends with regret and ointment.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>7. GRAMPS × 3 (Jas10241958) — 4-5, 1269.8 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Jonathan Taylor (224.3 pts)</p>
  <p>Taylor runs like he’s late for his daily Cialis dose — powerful, efficient, and fueled by spite.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> GRAMPS is proof you don’t have to be young to put up big numbers. It’s all experience, endurance, and a suspiciously high heart rate.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>8. THE U (sYsTeMheaD) — 4-5, 1225.6 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Drake Maye (187.4 pts)</p>
  <p>Drake Maye’s throwing it around like a college freshman at his first frat party — reckless, confident, and somehow it’s working.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> THE U has big “started strong, finished too early” energy. This team’s foreplay is electric, but the follow-through needs work.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>9. CGG (Cgokan35) — 4-5, 1216.1 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Baker Mayfield (138.8 pts)</p>
  <p>Baker plays with the energy of a guy who yells “let’s make this quick” and still needs a towel after. Chaotic. Unpredictable. Occasionally impressive.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> CGG’s roster is like that hookup you text at 2 AM — not your first choice, but you know exactly what you’re getting: average results and minor regret.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>10. Love Hurts (benessig) — 4-5, 1185.7 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Jalen Hurts (176.6 pts)</p>
  <p>Hurts hits the fantasy G-spot every week — mobile, dominant, and always leaving defenders in a heap of shame.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> The name’s no lie — Love Hurts has the raw talent, but too many busted performances. It’s like tantric fantasy football: long, frustrating, and unsatisfying for everyone involved.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>11. Dead Rabbits (JustinMcAndrews) — 4-5, 1089.5 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Caleb Williams (152.4 pts)</p>
  <p>Caleb’s dragging this corpse of a team like a man carrying his drunk friend home from the bar — determined but clearly questioning his life choices.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> Dead Rabbits are hanging on by a thread and pure stubbornness. It’s not sexy, but damn it, you respect the effort. Like a bad porno — awful execution, but everyone’s trying.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>12. Big D (sdallas979) — 3-6, 1251.4 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Ja’Marr Chase (187.7 pts)</p>
  <p>Ja’Marr’s putting in work like a professional — hands everywhere, no drops, pure showmanship.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> Big D has big potential but soft follow-through. This squad teases 160 every week and finishes with 120. It’s the blue balls of fantasy rosters.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>13. The JayHawks (JayHawk477) — 3-6, 1140.1 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Drake London (133.7 pts)</p>
  <p>London’s got moves, but he’s more tease than finish — all foreplay, no fireworks.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> JayHawks talk a big game but ghost the scoreboard when it matters. The fantasy equivalent of getting catfished by your own draft.</p>
</div>

<div class="sep">⸻</div>

<div class="team">
  <h2>14. Warriors (warriors85) — 2-7, 1170.4 pts</h2>
  <p class="star">Star: Patrick Mahomes (202.8 pts)</p>
  <p>Mahomes is out here putting up porn star numbers while the rest of the team watches from the sidelines eating chips.</p>
  <p><strong>Team vibe:</strong> The Warriors are that guy at the orgy who showed up ready, but everyone else forgot the invite. Mahomes deserves alimony after this season.</p>
